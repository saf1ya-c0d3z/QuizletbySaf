In this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create and style a coding quiz withou a starter code.  I considered fucntionality of links, efficiency in code and using HTML, CSS and JavaScript properties to make the most efficent and functional website.

As I worked I considered the following...

## User Story

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
